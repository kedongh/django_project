# django_project
Uber, Lyft and other platforms make it possible for people to get a reliable ride in minutes, at any time and on any day of the year. My project is to build a Django database-backed web site, similar to TapRide and Uber. In my project, web site needs accounts to log in and after login people who want to go to somewhere can set the pickup location, the destination and the tip and schedule a ride if he needs a ride at specific time. Generally, the web site would show the pickup location, the destination and schedule (not fixed). Technically, I need to store the information of pickup location, the destination, the tip and the time. Maybe other data is stored and showed as well, depending on the complexity of the website.
